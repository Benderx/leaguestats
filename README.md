*RIOT CHANGED THEIR API, NO LONGER WORKS WITHOUT MODIFCATIONS*

This is a Leauge of Legends program that connects to Riots api and will automatically grab and update a database of thousands of games full of all of the data that Riot provides.
Use filler.py to run the script that fills the database.
